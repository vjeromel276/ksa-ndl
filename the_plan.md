First off, you're not crazy at allâ€”you're ambitious! ðŸŽ¯ Aiming for 90%+ accuracy is definitely a stretch goal (think "moonshot"), but not impossibleâ€”especially with careful planning, disciplined analysis, iterative testing, and good old-fashioned stubbornness. Letâ€™s dig into your assumptions, clarify expectations, and map out a practical path forward.

## ðŸ“Œ **Your Goals in Context**

You're aiming for forward-looking stock-price predictions over:

* **Very Short-Term:** 1 & 3 days
* **Short-to-Medium Term:** 5 & 15 days
* **Medium-Term:** 30 days

And you want a systematic, iterative approach:

1. **Rigorous backtesting** to refine and validate models.
2. **Real-time validation** by comparing predictions with actual outcomes.
3. Gradual improvement in accuracy toward an ambitious target (>90%).

## ðŸ§  **Real Talk: Can We Hit 90%+ Accuracy?**

**What you're proposing (90%+ accuracy) is very challenging** for financial markets, and here's why:

* **Market Efficiency**: Markets quickly incorporate available information, making predictions inherently noisy.
* **Stochasticity (Randomness)**: Financial data has inherent randomness, meaning predictions often have a ceiling in accuracy.
* **Non-stationarity**: Market patterns constantly evolveâ€”strategies that worked yesterday may not work tomorrow.

> ðŸ’¡ **Typical baseline** for short-term directional stock-price prediction (up/down) accuracy:
>
> * **Random Guessing:** \~50%
> * **Typical Quantitative Models (good performance):** 55% - 65%
> * **Highly Advanced Proprietary Strategies (elite hedge funds, very short horizons):** can achieve higher, but sustained accuracy above \~70-75% is extremely rare.

Your 90% accuracy goal is very aspirational. However, this ambition is excellent for driving disciplined, meticulous research and model improvement.

## ðŸš© **Common Misconceptions & Adjustments**

Hereâ€™s where you might be slightly off (and how we can adjust):

1. **Accuracy vs. Profitability**

   * **Misconception**: Higher accuracy = guaranteed higher returns.
   * **Reality**: You can have 55% accuracy and be profitable if your winners consistently outweigh your losers.
   * **Adjustment**: Consider profitability metrics (Sharpe ratio, cumulative returns, drawdowns) alongside accuracy.

2. **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Predictability**

   * **Misconception**: Shorter windows (1-3 days) are easier.
   * **Reality**: Extremely short-term predictions are dominated by noise. Medium windows (5-30 days) can sometimes have more stable signals.
   * **Adjustment**: Include both short- and medium-term windows to discover sweet spots.

3. **Data Limitations**

   * **Misconception**: More data always means better predictions.
   * **Reality**: Quality of signals often matters more than quantity of data.
   * **Adjustment**: Focus on feature engineeringâ€”creating meaningful indicators and signals from your existing data.

4. **Statistical Rigor**

   * **Misconception**: You can skip statistical basics and still reliably interpret model outcomes.
   * **Reality**: Basic statistical intuition (distributions, confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, correlation vs. causation) greatly improves understanding and decision-making.
   * **Adjustment**: Invest a bit of time in learning foundational statistics. I'll help you grasp critical concepts step-by-step, tailored directly to your financial modeling tasks.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Strategic Next Steps & Roadmap**

Hereâ€™s the **iterative roadmap** I propose:

### ðŸŸ¢ **1. Baseline Setup**

* Develop simple baseline models (MLP, XGBoost, or Logistic Regression for direction) to set initial benchmarks.
* Clearly establish backtesting and evaluation pipelines (already underwayâ€”great work!).

### ðŸŸ¢ **2. Statistical Fundamentals Crash Course**

Letâ€™s schedule focused sessions on:

* Statistical distributions and how they impact your predictions.
* Hypothesis testing to rigorously determine if your improvements are real or just lucky fluctuations.
* Confidence intervals and performance measurement.

I'll keep these practical, concise, and directly relevant to your models.

### ðŸŸ¢ **3. Iterative Model Improvement**

* Implement iterative feature engineering to improve signal extraction.
* Introduce ensemble methods and stackingâ€”combining models to leverage strengths.
* Experiment with advanced approaches: LSTM/RNN for sequential patterns, transformer-based architectures, and advanced quant strategies like regime detection or Bayesian methods.

### ðŸŸ¢ **4. Continuous Validation**

* Compare predictions regularly against real-world outcomes.
* Analyze differences and iteratively tune model parameters and approaches based on findings.
* Automate reporting dashboards for continuous evaluation and insight extraction.

---

## ðŸš€ **Where We Can Innovate**

* **Meta-learning**: Dynamically adapt models based on recent performance.
* **Regime-switching models**: Different models for different market states (volatile vs stable markets).
* **Alternative data**: Integrate sentiment, economic indicators, news, social media data (e.g., FinBERT, macroeconomic signals).

---

## ðŸ“– **How I'll Help (Collaborative Teaching)**

My commitment to you:

* **Step-by-step explanations**: No unnecessary jargon; Iâ€™ll always clarify in plain English first.
* **Interactive learning**: Regular check-ins on what makes sense or doesnâ€™t.
* **Guided statistical intuition**: Teach you how to interpret results meaningfully.
* **Humor and encouragement**: Keep the mood light, motivating, and productive.

## ðŸ’¡ **Final Reality Check**

Can we guarantee 90% accuracy soon? No. But can we develop robust, consistently improving, profitable models? **Absolutely yes.**

This ambitious journey will make you a stronger analyst, engineer, and thinker, no matter the final accuracy number. Youâ€™re definitely on a solid path. Your thinking isnâ€™t wrongâ€”it just needs some refinement and grounding in practical realities.

### ðŸŽ‰ **Next Immediate Steps:**

* Set up baseline backtesting clearly, get those initial accuracy benchmarks established.
* Schedule our first mini-statistics lesson around interpreting prediction performance.
